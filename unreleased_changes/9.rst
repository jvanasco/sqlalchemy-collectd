    The "pid" value that is collected by the client plugin and passed to the
    aggregator in order to disambiguate separate processes is now augmented
    by a six character random hex string, so that a single host that may have
    the same pid repeated, such as when process namespaces or containers are
    used, sends correct statistics for the same program name configuration.
