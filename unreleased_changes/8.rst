    The "connmon" tool can now display stats for SQLAlchemy stats that are sent
    to a collectd server via the "network" plugin or through any other means.
    Previously, the connmon tool could only display stats for messages that
    were sent to a the collectd server by the SQLAlchemy-collectd plugin
    itself.

    The server side configuration for "connmon" is now separate from that of
    the SQLAlchemy-collectd plugin, and the two plugins can run independently
    of each other.  This allows for a configuration where many hosts send
    SQLAlchemy-collectd messages to local collectd servers for aggregation, and
    those servers then pass their messages onto another collectd server, where
    the "connmon" tool can provide a view inside the current stats.

    In order to achieve this, major refactoring such that the internals now
    deal with data in terms of a structure which mirrors the collectd-python
    "Values" object is in place, along with a rearchitecture of the connmon
    tool such that it now consumes collectd "Values" objects from a particular
    collectd server regardless of how those "Values" arrived in that server.
